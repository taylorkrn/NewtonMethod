# Finding and Plotting Roots of Polynomials using the Newton Method

## A homework project from the University of Bremen

In the folder, we find 4 files:

- *script.m:* This file, when executed, runs the Newon Method on a range of 2000 Starting points between x = -1 -i and x = 1 i.
                    To which root these starting points then converge is plotted (using colors)
- *newton.m:* This file takes the input of a starting point, a function, the functions first derivative and an allowable error and returns (when possible) a root of the function
- *f.m:* A function (in this case x^5 - 1 a 5th order polynomial)
- *fdash.m* The first derivative of the function defined in f.m

This project is a simple example of the many Numerical mathematical problems that I undertook while studying mathematics. It shows my ability to write basic matlab script, functions and plot results.
